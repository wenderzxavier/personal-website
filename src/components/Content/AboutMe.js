    My name is Wender Xavier. I am a Software Engineer with 6+ years of
    professional experience.
    <br />
    <br />
    My software engineer journey revolves around interest and curiosity. While I
    was still a building technician, I was curious to see my brothers
    programming on black screens and celebrating simply by waiting for user
    input, making a silly calculation, and displaying the result on a terminal
    screen. I decided to study computer science, and my interest in the area
    grew more and more.
    <br />
    <br />
    At first, it was challenging. In the first Algorithms and Data Structure
    exam, several people in the room had been coding for a long time, and it was
    my first contact with programming. I remember staying up all night studying
    how the computer processes each request, the flows of a program, and which
    data structures perform best for certain types of problems. As a result, I
    got a 100 on the test. It was a relief and the certainty that I was in the
    right direction.
    <br />
    <br />
    During my entire graduation, I was not limited to learning in the classroom,
    as technology was advancing rapidly into several areas that I had never
    imagined (parallel programming, quantum programming, mobile devices,
    autonomous cars), and I wanted to have the opportunity to know a little
    about each technology. I became a generalist because of my curiosity.
    <br />
    <br />
    Nowadays, after my graduation in Computer Science, my experience as an
    entrepreneur, my Master's degree in Informatics, I see myself as a T-shaped
    person, being a reference in Frontend development, but not limited to just
    that. My curiosity and interest in computing continue to this day and have
    taken me to extraordinary places, to fantastic books, to learn new
    languages, to developing innovative products, to leadership positions I
    never imagined, and to influence people to constantly improve the code we
    send to production.

    Be curious.
