  <p className="light">
    My name is Wender Xavier. I am a Software Engineer with 4+ years of
    professional experience.
    <br />
    <br />
    My experience as a developer started in the academic area, developing
    systems and algorithms in scientific initiations during graduation, which
    made me start my Master’s degree. During my Masters, I researched in the
    area of urban mobility, developing algorithms based on complex network
    metrics to understand the transport systems and propose better ways of
    dimensioning public transportation. During this time, I also co-founded a
    computer company called HiveSys focused on developing intelligent systems to
    improve the way other companies work. This experience of creating a company
    brought great learning both in technical skills but also in communication
    skills and influence with prospective clients.

    In 2019 I was hired by ThoughtWorks to work as a Consultant Developer.
    Working for a massive South America airline, I could improve ancillaries
    products implementing micro frontends increasing the conversion rate by more
    than 30%. This experience was a big step in my career because it made it
    possible to learn agile methodologies and best practices implemented in
    large companies. I had the opportunity to work with multiple technologies
    during my academic/professional career, which gave me a broader view of how
    I could apply my knowledge in different areas, however, I had a shallow
    understanding of these technologies. Trying to become a more T-shaped
    person, I started focusing my career to become a front-end developer with
    React as the main framework.
    <br />
    <br />
    My resilience and continuous desire to learn are my strongest qualities. I
    try to see every problem as something waiting to be solved. But only with
    experience and a critic view of the problem you can see the right time to
    attack the problem, and also the most effective way. For this reason, I
    still consider myself a mid-level senior. I’m starting to share tech-related
    content on platforms e.g. posting code snippets (including this website). My
    career goal is to become a Tech Lead and reference for a team.
